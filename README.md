The data set is a cardiovascular data set. As a cardiovascular scientist, I set out to carry out linear and logistic regression, find corellations between systolic blood pressure, age, alcohol consumption and obesity AND chronic heart disease. 
I split my data set into test and train data, trained my model and tested my model.
This study was done in partial fulfillment of my certification by ReDI, Munich as a Data Scientist. 
I am thankful to my Teachers at ReDI who have taken the time to teach indepth concepts of data science and machine learning. 
As I to apply these concepts to even larger data sets, I hope to make my Teachers and Mentors very proud.
Special thanks also goes to the organisers and Funders of ReDI School Munich for all efforts to enhance learning and employability of students.
